# Jamf Pro Extension Attributes
Extension attributes for use with Jamf Pro.

Note: I am currently not using Jamf Pro. Updating these EAs is best effort, but do feel free to file issues or PRs.

As of 4/9/2022 these have been converted to Python 3 since Apple removed system Python 2 in macOS 12.3. Be sure to either change the shebang to a Python path you manage (like [MacAdmins Python](https://github.com/macadmins/python) or a [relocatable Python build](https://github.com/gregneagle/relocatable-python)) or call it directly with an installed Python 3 interpreter.
